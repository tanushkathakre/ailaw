facts: A jury found Randall Fields guilty of two counts of third-degree criminal sexual conducQ for the sexual abuse
of a thirteen-year-old child. Fields was in jail on a disorderly charge when Lenawee County, Michigan deputies
questioned him about allegations of sex with a minor. The sex case was unrelated to the one Fields was in jail for
at the time. Fields filed an appeal of right in the Michigan court of Appeals clairrving that his statements were
inadmissible because he had not been given his Miranda warnings before questioning. The state court reasoned that
because Fields was free to return to the jail and was questioned on a matter unrelated to his incarceration, there
was no obligation to provide him warnings under Miranda. Fields then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus
under 28 you-S.C. S 2254 claiming thaw his Fifth Amendment right against selfÄncrimination was violated, and the
you. s. District court agreed. The united states court of Appeals for the sixth Circuit affirmed.
